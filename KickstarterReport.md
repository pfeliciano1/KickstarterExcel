# Kickstarter Report

*1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?*

    With the given data we had the three conclusions I can draw from the Kickstarter campaigns are:

    •	The bigger the Goal, less successful the Kickstarter campaigns are. In which you can see it in the sheet Data2 when calculating how many Successful, Failed or Canceled campaigns, the campaigns under $10,000 were more successful in general.

    •	July is the peak for each campaign no matter which state if we look by Category.

    •	Lastly, 2/3 of the Sub-Category “plays campaigns” are Successful and it is the Sub-Category with the most backers.

*2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?*

    If we talk about the Raw Data, is definitely very difficult for anyone to understand mostly what the story of the table is. So overall, the data is not completely clean in which we can determine a conclusion out of it unless is better organize and shown. For example, the dates of each campaign started or ended was in Time Stamp format which is not clear for most of the people. Also, for such a big dataset was hard to navigate through the data without ways of sorting or looking at data by format or even any type of chart.

*3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*

    We can add a Recommended Pivot Table which will show the Percentage Funded per state of the Goal or even per Category. Also, we create different charts such as 2-D or 3-D lines and columns, treemap, sunburst, pie charts, scatter plots and even charts in which we can combine some of the types too.

## Bonus Statistics:

*4.	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.*

    In this specific case, the data is so large that the mean and the median are close enough numerically, even though in the dataset the number range is from 6 to 930. So, I think that between them either the mean or the median is going to be more meaningful than the other. But if I have to choose one between mean or median for being more meaningful will be the mean, just because in the calculation of it includes all values from the dataset.  

*5.	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?*

    The information gathered and analyzed in this matter shows that the successful campaigns have more variability because of the number of backers in some of the campaigns. And it makes sense, because taking the first question one of the conclusions draw from the data was that “The bigger the Goal, the less successful campaign”. So, if we go and look at the Data2 table in the goals between $0-$9,999 the number of backers is very high for small amounts.
